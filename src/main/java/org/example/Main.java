//Solution for Problem 2 will be written here
//To solve, you could take a piece from each of the bags, but each bag would take one extra for whichever bag it represents
//For example for the first back, you take one, for the 5th you take 5, until all 20 bags are out
//Then you put all of the mnms from the bags onto the scale, and measure, and assuming each bag would be 1 gramp pieces, it would total to 210 grams
//Since one bag has a greater amount, you it will not be that exact amount, .n or whichever bag had more, so if the total is 210.6, then it would of been the 6th bag with the 1.1 pieces since you multiply1.1*6, and use that number instead when adding
